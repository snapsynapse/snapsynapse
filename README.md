### Hi, I'm Sam Rogers 👋

Founder · Builder · Educator · Utah, USA

I build tools for a world that's **interoperable, secure, and collaborative**. Tech that deserves to exist is tech that respects our data, works across platforms, and gets out of the way of human intent. Nothing else is worth building.

👉 Tools can work together, privacy is verifiable, and humans and AI can collaborate effectively toward Aggregate Intelligence. Gatekeeping and lock-in are not in my interest, and probably not in yours either. So let's build better than that!
