### Hi, I'm Sam Rogers 👋

Founder · Builder · Educator · Utah, USA

I build tools for a world that's **interoperable, secure, and collaborative**. Software that respects your data, works across platforms, and gets out of your way, is software that deserves to exist. Nothing else is worth our time.

---> Tools should work together, privacy should be verifiable, and humans and AI should collaborate effectively — without gatekeeping or lock-in.
